### 🎁 Product Unboxing Photography: Gift Set Documentation

![Perfume Unboxing Experience](Assets/images/perfume-unboxing-grid.jpg)

**What it does**: A premium 2x2 photo grid showcasing the complete luxury perfume gift set unboxing experience - from the initial reveal to the final product interaction.

**Why it's impressive**:
- ✅ **Advanced Complexity**: More technically challenging than V60 - requires extreme consistency in shadows, textures, and product placement
- ✅ **Commercial-Grade**: Blank products make it universally adaptable for any brand
- ✅ **Sequential Storytelling**: Frame 1 (Anticipation) → Frame 2 (Reveal) → Frame 3 (Interaction) → Frame 4 (Experience)
- ✅ **Technical Mastery**: Google Imagen 4 Ultra + Nanobanana + Upscayl upscaling
- ✅ **Real-World Challenges**: Overcame grid consistency problems through iterative regeneration

**Use Cases**: E-commerce product photography, luxury brand marketing, unboxing content, social media campaigns, product launches

## **About Me**  

Hey! I am **Aman**, an aspiring **AI Prompt Engineer**, and I love working with language models to solve actual problems, not just theoretical ones.  

## **What I Do Best**
Prompt Crafting: Designing prompts that get more accurate, useful results from AI

## **What I Do**
Recently, I’ve been getting deep into generating media with AI. All my prompt work now is centered on a few exciting areas:

**Text-to-Video:** Writing prompts that turn a short story or idea directly into animated visual clips

**Text-to-Image:** Using simple descriptions to create original images or artwork

**Image-to-Image:** Tweaking existing images by guiding the AI to make changes, transformations, or enhancements

**Image-to-Video:** Transforming a single image into a video sequence or animation

**Reference-to-Video:** Taking a reference (like a photo or style sample) and using it as inspiration to produce customized video content

Basically, if it’s about converting text or images into something creative and visual—whether still or moving—I’m exploring and sharing prompts that make the magic happen.
