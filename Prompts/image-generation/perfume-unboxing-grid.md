## 🎯 The Prompt

```
Unboxing Perfume Gift Pack (2x2 Grid Concept):

Top Left: a cardboard rectangular Box Partially Open, Brown colored gift box, lid half-lifted, a hand is holding the right corner of the lid from where the box is opened, four identical, small perfume bottles (with blank, label-free surfaces) are partially visible inside as the lid is partially opened, Lighting is dramatic; all box and bottle details are clear and consistent.

Top Right (Box Fully Open, Identical Details): The same box is now fully open, showing all four blank perfume bottles neatly arranged, Hand position would be gently holding the bottom right corner of the box, but all contents inside the box remain completely unchanged from the previous image, No accessories or added packaging—just the bottles in the same spots.

Bottom Left (Picking Up a Bottle): The open box with three bottles remaining inside exactly as before, A hand picks up ONE perfume bottle from the right side (blank, no logo), holding it slightly above the box, The picked bottle is visually identical in every frame, All contents inside the box remain completely unchanged from the previous image, No accessories or added packaging—remaining three bottles in the same spots.

Bottom Right (Spraying Perfume): The same hand now holds the previously picked perfume bottle outside the box, The bottle is shown being pressed, with a fine mist visibly spraying out in a beautiful arc, The bottle remains blank/no logo; details of mist and product form are emphasized.

Instructions for Consistency:
All bottles should be of the same size, color, and material with no text or branding throughout.
The box style, placement, and lighting must remain identical in every image.
The hand, bottle, and box positions should progress logically, showing continuity in product interaction.
No additional products or props other than the gift box and four perfume bottles.

## ⚠️ Technical Challenges Faced

### **The Grid Consistency Problem**
When creating 2x2 grids with AI, making changes to ONE panel often affected OTHER panels unexpectedly, even when not mentioned in the prompt.

**Solution Approach:**
- Generate first image completely
- Download and save it
- Make incremental changes to single panels
- Repeat entire process if consistency breaks
- Sometimes had to start from scratch multiple times

### **Complexity Comparison: V60 vs Perfume Unboxing**

**V60 Coffee Grid (Simpler):**
- Objects were straightforward to generate
- Fewer intricate details to maintain
- Natural props (coffee, grinder, kettle)
- More forgiving on consistency

**Perfume Unboxing Grid (More Complex):**
- ⚠️ **Shadow Consistency**: Maintaining identical shadows across frames
- ⚠️ **Box Details**: Cardboard texture, fold lines, lid position
- ⚠️ **Bottle Placement**: Exact positioning of 4 identical bottles
- ⚠️ **Hand Continuity**: Natural progression of hand movements
- ⚠️ **Lighting Precision**: Dramatic lighting that stays consistent
- ⚠️ **Material Realism**: Glass bottles, cardboard box, mist spray

### **Key Learnings**
1. **Micro-details matter** in product photography prompts
2. **Explicit consistency rules** are crucial for multi-panel work
3. **Iterative approach** is necessary for commercial-quality outputs
4. **Post-processing** (Upscayl upscaling) enhances final quality
5. **Patience required** - sometimes starting over yields better results than forcing edits
