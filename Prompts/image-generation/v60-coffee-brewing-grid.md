## 🎯 The Prompt

```
A 2x2 photo grid showing the V60 pour-over coffee brewing process. The overall aesthetic should be top-down, clean, with consistent lighting, and a soft wooden background, utilizing a neutral color palette, featuring a man as subject with light grey tone shirt. A book on the right side as fixed background, only top-end is visible, with a glasses on top partially. A thin cream border 2-4px must separate each frame. All four frames should have identical warmth, achieved through a subtle LUT or color balance correction. The entire image should feature high-resolution photography, realistic lighting, and shallow depth of field, with a cinematic composition, and an aspect ratio of 1:1.

Each individual frame should adhere to the following descriptions:

Top-left: A close-up of hands grinding coffee beans in a manual coffee hand grinder, conveying a rustic tone with natural daylight.

Top-right: Assembling a V60 dripper and filter over a glass carafe, followed by adding ground coffee from the spoon, set within the same natural daylight tone.

Bottom-left: Pouring hot water with a gooseneck kettle into the V60, showcasing visible steam and water flow, with cinematic lighting.

Bottom-right: Pouring freshly brewed coffee from the carafe into a ceramic cup, holding the cup from one hand, and carafe with another.
